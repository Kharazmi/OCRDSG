# OCRDSG (OCR Dataset Generator)
Written by S.S.Nobakht, S.R.Hosseyni Nezhad, KHARAZMI UNIVERSITY

OCRDSG is a tool to create a dataset for the Optical Character Recognition problem. We designed this tool during our Master thesis at Kharazmi University.
OCRDSG was written in C#, but you could run it on Unix-based environments via MONO, or other related tools.
Our tool supports cursive scripts that exist in a few languages such as Farsi, Arabic, etc.
You can apply a few effects like rotation and wrapping to your texts and generate dataset images with their equivalent OCRed texts.
